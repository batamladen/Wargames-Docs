## Contributing to WBM

We welcome community contributions! You can help improve the platform in **two main areas**: the Academy section and the Wargame Challenges.

<br/>

### 1. Academy Section

The Academy is a community-driven space for learning cybersecurity skills. Anyone, with experiance in the topic of interest, can contribute by **writing lessons for the modules**.

#### How to Contribute:

1. Visit our GitHub issue listing available modules and lessons: [Modules Contribution Needed](https://github.com/batamladen/Wargames-BataMladen/issues/2)
2. Choose a lesson that is still open for contribution.
3. Write the lesson in your preferred format (.txt, .docx, .pdf) or submit a **pull request** directly with your contribution.
4. Include suggested for the tasks section. Either **closed-type tasks** with answers ; or **open-type questions** with correct answer; or **exercises/scenarios** with a nice description, at the end of the lesson - and we will make it happend.
5. If sending via email, use: `contact@batamladen.com`

<br/>

**Note 1:** If you want to contribute via pull requests, to make your life easier, we made a blank **lesson page** and a **module page** template [here](https://github.com/batamladen/Wargames-BataMladen/tree/main/academy/Templates). 

**Note 2:** Lesson topics can be modified — feel free to propose adding, removing, or renaming lessons.

<br/>

### 2. Wargame Challenges

Contributions can also be made to the platform’s wargame challenges.

#### How to Contribute:

1. Contact the platform maintainer directly to discuss your scenario idea. Links to socials can be found in, you will never beleave it - [Socials](./Socials.md)
2. Use the existing **challenge templates** to create your level. Templates are available in the documentation under:  
   `backend/Levels Dockerimage.md`
3. Once the scenario and level design are ready, the challenge can be integrated as a new Docker-based level.
