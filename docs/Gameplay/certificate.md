## The Challenge Certificate

When you complete a wargame challenge, you earn more than just aura points —  
you earn a **mark of mastery**: a digital **Challenge Certificate**.

It symbolizes not only that you’ve solved the challenges,  
but that you’ve grown through them — learned, adapted, and persisted.

<br/>

## What It Includes

Each certificate includes:
- Your **username**
- Challenge name
- **Completion date**
- Aura Points earned
- A unique **verification ID**
