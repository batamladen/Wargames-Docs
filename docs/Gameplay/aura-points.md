## What Are Aura Points?

Aura Points are the **experience system** of the Wargames platform.  
They represent your **skill, persistence, and mastery** as you progress through challenges & academy.

The more aura points you have, the higher you place on our [Scoreboard](https://wargames.batamladen.com/scoreboard.html).

## Why Aura Matters

Aura is not just a score — it’s your **reputation**.

It reflects:
- The time you’ve invested  
- The knowledge you’ve gained  

It’s also tied to **scoreboards** and **player profiles**, helping you showcase progress to others in the community.
Also... Higher levels may unlock **exclusive content/gifts**.

> “In forgetting, we learn.  
>  In struggle, we shine.  
>  Aura is the memory that refuses to fade,  
>  and shows the brightness of your mind.“

## Losing Aura?

You can’t lose aura points.  
Every lesson learned stays with you — even if you fail a level or restart a challenge.

However, replaying already completed levels won’t grant additional points (no farming, sorry 🧘).
