## What Youâ€™ll Need

To start conquering the wargames, you will need theese "pre-requisites":
- Any desktop device
- Registered account ([Register Here](https://wargames.batamladen.com/register.html))
- Patience & curiosity

<br/>

## Entering the Platform
The platform can be entered one of two ways:
- by logging in with an account
- by entering a password that is hidden on the website.

### Anonymous login
The password entery is made for users who want to enter the platform anonymouosly, but to achive that, you have to prove that you deserve it by finding the password.

The goal here is... well there is no goal. It is a fun little web-puzzle to solve as a warm up.

The password is not hard to find it requires some basic knowledge.  
Keep in mind that entering anonymously does allow you to play the wargames - but not to submit the flags or enter the academy section. For that you will need to register and login.
